# How's Github a usefull platform!!
This assignment is really a cool thing to do, since this was my very first time attending the github community seeing what we can achieve by just having a account on github amazes me, how one can use his work update his work and revert his work, along with that i can work with my team members without any issue. this feature has also been copied by google docs which i just came to know originally it was taken from github. apart from that from what i just did the resreach github is a source where i can see other people gits which to improve my programming skills where as i can also post my stuff online and get the world know about my programming skills!
# Github Concluding Review
ill motivate every programmer to have a awesome source code platform and i think github is the one where they should give out there source codes to have their profile smug!
